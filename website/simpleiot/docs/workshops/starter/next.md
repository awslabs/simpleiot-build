You are now ready to explore the world of connected devices and to generate your own device data. 

For those looking for more in-depth information there is extensive documentation on the [Command-Line-Interface](/docs/documentation/cli/intro), the [Arduino Client SDK](/docs/documentation/sdk/arduino/intro), and what happens to the [data](/docs/documentation/data/intro) you are sending tothe cloud and what you can do with it.

[M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/), the manufacturer of the Core2 device, [sells a wide range of sensors and actuators](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-sensor) with which you can experiment.

These include:

- Light sensors
- Thermocouples
- Switches and buttons
- Ultrasonic Distance sensor
- RFID reader
- CANBus for connection to vehicles and industrial automation devices
- Cellular and LoRa modems
- Voltmeter and Ammeter units, and
- Motor controller relays

Feel free to experiment, and share your projects with us through social media. This is just the beginning.
