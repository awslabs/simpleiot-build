Welcome to **SimpleIOT**, a framework for creating and managing cloud-connected devices.

Here you will find documentation for the REST API built into the system. It is used by the Command-Language-Interface (CLI),
the web dashboard, and any third-party services that need to integrate with the system.

## Device Lifecycle

Designing and building a connected-device is a non-trivial task. But there is much more involved. From mass-production, to provisioning,
maintaining, repairing, and a wide range of other operations having to do with the lifecycle of devices.

**SimpleIOT** is designed to evolve and help address many parts (and eventually all) stages of the lifecycle. It allows
device-makers to focus on what's unique about their project instead of the undifferentiated heavy lifting.

## Concepts

![Basic Concepts](/img/api/Slide1.png)

In the **SimpleIOT** universe, an installation supports one or more *Projects*. Each *Project* can support one or more
*Models*. A *Model* is a definition of a single device. Each *Model* has one or more *DataTypes* which are items that
the device wants to share with the cloud.

Think of a *Model* as a sort of object-oriented class definition, with *DataTypes* as variables. When a device is created, it
is instantiated as a *Device* with a single *Data* element based on the *DataTypes* defined for the model. Each *Device*
is required to have a unique serial number.

At runtime, each *Device* instance can exchange data to/from the cloud using its *Data* elements which act as 'named slots'.
Values sent from the device can be transmitted via REST APIs or MQTT messages, addressed to each name. Values sent from the cloud
are sent to the same named slots and the values are relayed to the device via MQTT messages.

## Interaction with the system

Access to the API is regulated via User Authentication whereas MQTT authentication is managed via X.509 digital
certificates (automatically generated by SimpleIOT).

The REST API can be used by a range of services, including:

- Management dashboards
- Command-language interfaces
- Monitoring systems
- Custom web apps
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Mobile apps (coming)
- Third-party integrations (coming)

Devices can interact with the system via:

- MQTT messages (direct)
- MQTT messages (proxied through gateway)
- REST APIs (direct)
- REST APIs (proxied through gateway)
- Bluetooth/BLE (proxied through gateway - upcoming)

## Data Collection

Data elements collected from a device can be transmitted to the cloud via provided SDKs or published APIs. Once there,
the data is sent to the back-end, where further operations can be performed.

## Connectivity Patterns

There are a number of ways a device can connect to the cloud. These include, but are not limited to:

- Direct connect
- Via gateway
- Via mobile device
- Relayed while in-transit

## Deployment Locations

Once devices have gone into production, instances can be installed in distinct physical locations.
**SimpleIOT** supports the concept of *placing* a device in a location, and allowing all devices in a
location to be viewed and managed individually or as a group.
