title: How to Install
---

There are two ways to install the SimpleIOT back-end:

1. The Easy Way: You answer a few questions and grab some coffee.
2. From source: You download the source code to your machine, install the pre-requisite tools, and run the same installer script. But this time, you can tweak the source code and configuration settings.

If new to SimpleIOT, we recommend you go with the Easy Way. Just go to the [next section](roles) to make sure you understand the differences between an Administrator and a Solo user.

But if you want to peek under the hood and see how things are done, head over to the [SimpleIOT github repo](https://github.com/awslabs/simpleiot) and clone (and star) the repo. Instructions on building from source can be [found here](/docs/advanced/installsource).
